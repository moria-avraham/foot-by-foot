## Overview
This project aims to develop a responsive full-stack web application suitable for screens as small as 15 inches (1536px). It draws inspiration from the Footlocker website and utilizes React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Additionally, FontAwesome is used for icon integration, and Redux manages the state of the application.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - FontAwesome
  - Redux

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

- Database:
  - MySQL

## Features
- CRUD operations for managing data in the MySQL database.
- Integration of FontAwesome icons for enhanced UI.
- State management using Redux for efficient data flow.

## Folder Structure
- `client/`: Contains frontend code built with React.js.
- `server/`: Contains backend code written in Node.js using Express.js.
- `database/`: Contains SQL scripts for setting up the MySQL database.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-node-mysql-app`
3. Install dependencies for the frontend: `cd client && npm install`
4. Install dependencies for the backend: `cd ../server && npm install`
5. Set up MySQL database using the scripts in the `database/` directory.
6. Configure the backend to connect to your MySQL database.
7. Start the frontend: `npm start` (from the `client/` directory)
8. Start the backend: `npm start` (from the `server/` directory)

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that Node.js and MySQL are installed on your system.
- There is a deployment to the site and you can see it in the link 
## Start the Node.js Server:
- Open server in the terminal and write npm start
## Start the React Development Server:
- Open shoes inside the client in the terminal and write npm run dev
