1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-node-mysql-app`
3. Install dependencies for the frontend: `cd client && npm install`
4. Install dependencies for the backend: `cd ../server && npm install`
5. Set up MySQL database using the scripts in the `database/` directory.
6. Configure the backend to connect to your MySQL database.
7. Start the frontend: `npm start` (from the `client/` directory)
8. Start the backend: `npm start` (from the `server/` directory)

## Additional Notes
